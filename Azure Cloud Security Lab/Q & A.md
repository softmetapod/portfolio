# Azure Lab Questions and Answers

## How does Azure Active Directory enhance security within the Azure environment?

Azure Active Directory enhances security by serving as an identity and access management service that supports conditional access policies and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This effectively weeds out unauthorized access to Azure resources.

## What role does Azure Firewall play in securing Azure virtual networks?

The role of Azure Firewall is akin to a gatekeeper for your Azure VNet and the internet; it scrutinizes all inbound and outbound traffic against set rules to shield against unauthorized access and attacks, allowing only verified traffic through.

## How does enabling encryption on Azure Storage Accounts protect data?

Encrypting Azure Storage Accounts protects data at rest either with Azure's own or customer-managed keys in Azure Key Vault, ensuring sensitive data remains out of unauthorized hands, even if they somehow access the storage account.

## What benefits does Azure Key Vault offer in terms of security?

Azure Key Vault's benefits include the secure storage of secrets, keys, and certificates, drastically reducing exposure risks. Its access policies grant retrieval rights solely to authorized applications and users.

## How does Azure Security Center help maintain a secure Azure environment?

Azure Security Center plays a pivotal role in maintaining a secure Azure environment through continuous security monitoring and actionable insights. It proactively identifies threats and offers real-time advanced threat protection.

## How does Azure Policy contribute to cloud security?

Azure Policy enforces organizational standards and compliance across Azure resources, ensuring adherence to corporate guidelines and service level agreements, thus fortifying the security framework.

## What is the purpose of Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs)?

Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) function to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources within a VNet. By defining security rules, NSGs manage access to resources, enhancing control over traffic flow.

## How does Azure's role-based access control (RBAC) enhance security?

Azure's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) tightens security by assigning specific roles to users, groups, and applications. This granular access management ensures individuals have only the necessary permissions, adhering to the principle of least privilege.

## What is Azure Defender, and how does it protect your cloud resources?

Azure Defender is a comprehensive cloud workload protection platform offering across-the-board threat protection for Azure services. It leverages AI to uncover and neutralize stealthy threats, providing guidance on risk mitigation.

## How do Azure Application Gateways contribute to application security?

Azure Application Gateways elevate application security through application-level routing and load balancing. They include Web Application Firewall (WAF) features, safeguarding web applications from common vulnerabilities by vetting inbound traffic and thwarting malicious requests, such as SQL injections and XSS attacks.
