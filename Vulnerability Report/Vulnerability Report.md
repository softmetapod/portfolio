# Vulnerability Report - Microsoft Defender & Power BI

## Objective
To build a comprehensive vulnerability report using Microsoft Defender vulnerability data, visualized through Power BI dashboards for actionable security insights and prioritized remediation.

## Overview
This project demonstrates the process of collecting, analyzing, and presenting vulnerability data from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint using Power BI. The report transforms raw security telemetry into clear, executive-ready visualizations that support risk-based decision making and vulnerability management workflows.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint:** Source of vulnerability and threat data across managed devices.
- **Microsoft Power BI:** Data visualization and dashboard platform for building the report.
- **Microsoft 365 Defender Portal:** Central console for reviewing security recommendations and exposure scores.

## Data Sources
- **Device Vulnerability Assessments:** Defender's built-in vulnerability scanning results across endpoints.
- **Software Inventory:** Installed software versions and associated CVEs identified by Defender.
- **Security Recommendations:** Prioritized remediation actions generated by Defender based on exposure and impact.
- **Exposure Scores & Secure Scores:** Quantitative metrics reflecting organizational security posture.

## Report Components

### Vulnerability Summary Dashboard
- Total vulnerabilities by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Breakdown of vulnerabilities by category and affected software
- Trending data showing vulnerability discovery over time

### Device Exposure Overview
- Number of exposed devices per vulnerability
- Device compliance and patching status
- Most vulnerable devices ranked by exposure score

### CVE Analysis
- Top CVEs affecting the environment ranked by severity and exploitability
- CVE-to-device mapping showing blast radius for each vulnerability
- CVSS score distribution across the environment

### Remediation Tracking
- Open vs. resolved vulnerabilities over time
- Remediation progress by team or device group
- Mean time to remediate (MTTR) metrics

## Methodology

### 1. Data Export from Microsoft Defender
- Connected Power BI to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint API to pull vulnerability assessment data.
- Exported device inventory, software inventory, and security recommendation datasets.

### 2. Data Transformation in Power BI
- Cleaned and normalized the raw data using Power Query.
- Created relationships between device, software, and vulnerability tables.
- Built calculated columns and measures for severity scoring, exposure metrics, and remediation tracking.

### 3. Dashboard Design
- Designed interactive dashboards with drill-down capabilities by severity, device group, and software.
- Applied conditional formatting to highlight critical and high-severity findings.
- Included slicers and filters for date ranges, device groups, and vulnerability categories.

### 4. Analysis & Reporting
- Identified the most critical vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention.
- Mapped vulnerability trends to patching cycles to evaluate remediation effectiveness.
- Generated executive summary views alongside detailed technical breakdowns.

## Key Findings
- Consolidated visibility into vulnerability posture across all Defender-managed endpoints.
- Identified high-severity CVEs with active exploits that required priority patching.
- Demonstrated the value of integrating Defender data with Power BI for continuous vulnerability monitoring.
- Provided stakeholders with clear, data-driven remediation priorities based on exposure and exploitability.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the ability to leverage Microsoft Defender for Endpoint as a vulnerability data source and Power BI as a reporting platform to build a professional vulnerability management report. The combination of automated data collection, structured analysis, and interactive visualization supports proactive security operations and informed risk management decisions.
