### Analyzing Cybersecurity Countermeasures Against NICKEL/APT25

#### Abstract

This research paper examines the cybersecurity countermeasures implemented by an organization in response to the threats posed by NICKEL (also identified as APT25), a China-based cyber espionage group. The study draws upon insights from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) to analyze the organization's strategic response to the sophisticated cyber espionage tactics employed by NICKEL. Through the adoption of advanced threat intelligence and the implementation of comprehensive defensive measures, the organization sought to enhance its network security against the advanced persistent threats represented by NICKEL.

#### Introduction

Cybersecurity remains a paramount concern for organizations worldwide, particularly in the face of advanced persistent threats (APTs) from state-sponsored actors. NICKEL/APT25, recognized for its extensive cyber espionage campaigns across various continents, targets governments, diplomatic entities, NGOs, and sectors critical to national security. This paper delves into the cyber defense mechanisms deployed by an organization to mitigate the risks associated with NICKEL's operations, which are characterized by exploiting unpatched systems and deploying custom malware to maintain long-term access to target networks.

#### Literature Review

The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center's investigations have highlighted NICKEL's extensive targeting range, affecting entities in Central and South America, the Caribbean, Europe, and North America. The group's strategy involves sophisticated credential theft, data exfiltration tactics, and the exploitation of vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications. This research reviews existing literature on NICKEL's methodologies, focusing on the technical and strategic aspects of countering such cyber espionage activities.

#### Methodology

The research methodology encompasses a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity measures implemented by the organization in question. This includes an examination of system hardening and patch management processes, monitoring and detection capabilities, access control mechanisms, and incident response strategies. The study assesses the effectiveness of these measures in countering NICKEL's known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

#### Findings

The findings indicate that a multi-layered defense strategy significantly enhances an organization's resilience against cyber espionage activities. Key aspects of the effective strategy include:

- **System Hardening and Patch Management**: Critical in closing vulnerabilities exploited by NICKEL, particularly in widely used applications like Microsoft Exchange and SharePoint.
- **Enhanced Monitoring and Detection**: Vital for identifying malicious activities associated with NICKEL, leveraging endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems to detect the use of credential dumpers and custom malware.
- **Credential Protection and Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**: Essential in mitigating the risk of credential compromise, which is often the initial foothold for cyber espionage groups.
- **User Education and Awareness**: Plays a crucial role in empowering employees to recognize and report phishing and other social engineering tactics.

#### Discussion

The research underscores the importance of an adaptive cybersecurity strategy that integrates the latest threat intelligence with comprehensive defensive measures. By focusing on technological solutions and fostering human vigilance, organizations can effectively defend against the sophisticated strategies employed by groups like NICKEL. The study also highlights the need for agility and informed decision-making in the cybersecurity domain to anticipate and neutralize emerging threats.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, this research artcile demonstrates that a proactive security posture, combining advanced technological solutions with human vigilance, is critical in mitigating the risks posed by sophisticated nation-state actors like NICKEL/APT25. The organization's strategic response, informed by MSTIC's insights, provides a valuable framework for other entities seeking to enhance their cybersecurity defenses against advanced persistent threats.
