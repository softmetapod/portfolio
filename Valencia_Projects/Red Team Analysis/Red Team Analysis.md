# Red Team Analysis for FFVVI.tech Network

## Executive Summary

This report details an enhanced Red Team analysis conducted to evaluate the security posture of FFVVI.tech's network. The Red Team, an internal group with cybersecurity expertise, uses adversarial tactics to test network defenses and uncover vulnerabilities. Contrasting with the Blue Team's defensive role, the Red Team simulates attacks to identify and exploit weaknesses in the network.

## Network Overview

The FFVVI.tech network, as visualized in the attached diagram, includes various Windows clients, servers, and network devices. Each component's security measures were scrutinized to assess the network's resilience against cyber threats.

## Pre-Assessments by the Red Team

### Email and Telephony Engineering

The Red Team employed social engineering techniques to acquire credentials that were improperly secured. The team successfully leveraged exposed client passwords, allowing unauthorized access to networked machines.

### Exploitation Tactics

#### Network Services

The lack of a centralized server with a dedicated firewall was a critical vulnerability. The team accessed files from a computer, revealing the potential for data breaches.

#### Physical Layer

Physical security assessments revealed inadequate access control. Some devices lacked passwords, while others used easily guessable ones, indicating a severe deficiency in physical security protocols.

#### Application Layer

Web-based applications and databases underwent thorough testing for security robustness. The team performed SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks, which identified several exploitable weaknesses.

## Red Team Methodology

### Scope of the Team

The Red Team's objective was to pinpoint network vulnerabilities from an attacker's perspective, adhering to defined engagement rules.

### Surveillance and Intelligence Gathering

Data collected included device IP addresses, API endpoints, employee information, and work-related data.

### Planning and Mapping Cyber Attacks

The team mapped attack vectors, considering factors like hidden sub-domains and cloud architecture misconfigurations.

### Execution of Cyber Attacks

Without firewall protection, the Red Team accessed hardware components and remotely uninstalled software, exploiting the lack of network segmentation into VLANs.

### Software Security Examination

Security applications, such as anti-virus software, were tested for efficacy and found lacking.

## Conclusion

The Red Team's assessment of FFVVI.tech's network revealed multiple vulnerabilities, underscoring the need for significant security enhancements. The absence of robust firewall defenses, poor password policies, and the lack of network segmentation were among the critical issues identified that could lead to potential cyber attacks.
