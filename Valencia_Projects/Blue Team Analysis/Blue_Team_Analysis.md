# Comprehensive Blue Team Network Security Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document articulates a meticulous Blue Team strategy, aimed at fortifying the defenses of our multi-device network. We dissect our approach to cater to the specific security requirements of each network component. Our goal is to ensure robust protection against unauthorized access, data breaches, and various cyber threats.

## Network Analysis Overview

Our network is structured using a star topology, which encompasses a wireless gateway router, a switch, multiple client computers, a DHCP server, a DNS/ADDS server, an IIS web server, and a network printer. The topology ensures dedicated communication pathways, however, our initial evaluation indicates significant security gaps due to the absence of password protection on key network devices.

## Device-Specific Hardening Strategies

### Router

**Vulnerabilities**:
- Currently lacks password protection, making it susceptible to unauthorized access and network eavesdropping.

**Hardening Measures**:
- Implement robust password protocols with AES encryption.
- Enable firewall capabilities and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).
- Regular firmware updates and disabling of unnecessary services.

### Switch

**Vulnerabilities**:
- No password protection, which may allow unauthorized configuration changes and potential network compromise.

**Hardening Measures**:
- Secure with a complex password and implement port security measures.
- Configure VLANs to segregate traffic and reduce attack surfaces.
- Enable Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) to assist with network traffic monitoring.

### Client Computers

**Vulnerabilities**:
- Clients may be exposed to malware or targeted attacks, risking the integrity and confidentiality of the network.

**Hardening Measures**:
- Ensure all clients have up-to-date antivirus and antimalware protection.
- Implement strict Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for system configuration and access control.
- Educate users on security best practices to prevent phishing and social engineering attacks.

### DHCP Server

**Vulnerabilities**:
- Simple passwords and lack of segmentation from client access.

**Hardening Measures**:
- Apply a complex password policy and encrypt transmissions where possible.
- Isolate the DHCP server in a separate VLAN and restrict access to authorized personnel only.
- Enable DHCP snooping on the switch to prevent unauthorized DHCP servers from issuing IP addresses.

### DNS/ADDS Server

**Vulnerabilities**:
- As a critical service, exposure to DNS attacks and unauthorized Active Directory modifications can be detrimental.

**Hardening Measures**:
- Harden the DNS service against cache poisoning and DNS amplification attacks.
- Enforce the principle of least privilege in Active Directory and conduct regular audits.
- Implement multi-factor authentication for sensitive accounts.

### IIS Web Server

**Vulnerabilities**:
- Web servers are prime targets for attacks aiming to disrupt services or to gain unauthorized access.

**Hardening Measures**:
- Keep the server and applications updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common exploits.
- Regularly review web server logs for signs of suspicious activity.

### Printer

**Vulnerabilities**:
- Network printers can be an overlooked entry point for attackers.

**Hardening Measures**:
- Change default credentials and regularly update the printer firmware.
- Configure the printer to only accept jobs from authorized network segments.
- Disable unnecessary protocols and services on the printer.

## Conclusion

By addressing the unique vulnerabilities of each device within our network, we can build a robust security posture that protects against a wide spectrum of cyber threats. This comprehensive approach ensures that security is not just a blanket application but a tailored fit for the intricacies of our network's architecture.
