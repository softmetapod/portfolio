# Web Application Exploits: A Practical Approach

## Objective

To demonstrate practical web application vulnerability assessment techniques using industry-standard penetration testing tools: Armitage for exploitation, OWASP ZAP for automated vulnerability scanning, and Burp Suite for HTTP traffic interception and analysis.

## Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Armitage | Graphical front-end for Metasploit; exploit execution and session management |
| OWASP ZAP | Automated web application vulnerability scanner |
| Burp Suite | HTTP/S proxy for intercepting, inspecting, and modifying web traffic |

## Armitage: Exploiting a Windows XP Target

Armitage provides a graphical interface for the Metasploit Framework, simplifying exploit selection and payload delivery. In this exercise, Armitage was used to establish a direct connection to a Windows XP target machine.

**Process:**
1. Configured the target IP in Armitage and performed a host scan to identify open services.
2. Selected an appropriate exploit based on the identified services and OS version.
3. Executed the exploit and established a Meterpreter session on the target.

**Key Takeaway:** Armitage demonstrates how unpatched legacy systems (Windows XP) remain trivially exploitable, reinforcing the importance of lifecycle management and patch compliance.

## OWASP ZAP: Automated Vulnerability Scanning

OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) is a free, open-source web application security scanner. A quick scan was performed against a target web application to identify common vulnerabilities.

**Findings:**
- **Password Autocomplete Enabled:** Login forms did not disable browser autocomplete, increasing the risk of credential exposure on shared machines.
- **Missing Security Headers:** Absence of headers like `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, and `Content-Security-Policy`.
- **Information Disclosure:** Server version information exposed in HTTP response headers.

**Key Takeaway:** Automated scanners like ZAP provide rapid identification of low-hanging vulnerabilities that are often overlooked in development. These findings represent OWASP Top 10 categories including Security Misconfiguration and Sensitive Data Exposure.

## Burp Suite: HTTP Traffic Interception

Burp Suite's proxy intercept feature was used to capture and analyze HTTP/S traffic between the browser and the target web application.

**Process:**
1. Configured the browser to route traffic through Burp Suite's proxy listener.
2. Enabled intercept mode to capture each request before it was sent to the server.
3. Analyzed request headers, parameters, and cookies for potential injection points and session management weaknesses.

**Key Takeaway:** Manual traffic interception reveals vulnerabilities that automated scanners may miss, such as logic flaws, improper session handling, and parameter tampering opportunities. Burp Suite is essential for thorough web application assessments.

## Conclusion

Each tool serves a distinct role in the web application security assessment workflow:

- **Armitage/Metasploit** excels at exploiting known vulnerabilities in network services and operating systems.
- **OWASP ZAP** provides fast, automated discovery of common web application security issues.
- **Burp Suite** enables deep manual analysis of application behavior through traffic interception.

Together, these tools provide comprehensive coverage for identifying, validating, and understanding web application vulnerabilities — a core skill set for penetration testers and security engineers.
