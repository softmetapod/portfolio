# Unmasking Roaming Mantis: The Mobile Malware Menace You Need to Know

**by Jacob Phillips on Mar 22, 2023 4:13:00 PM**

Roaming Mantis, also known as Shaoye, emerged as a DNS hijacking malware first identified in Japan by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky in 2018, following reports of DNS settings hijacking on routers. Initially a banking Trojan, it aimed at stealing financial credentials but has since broadened its attacks beyond Asia to Europe, notably France and Germany.

According to Kaspersky's statistics from September to December 2022, France, Japan, and the U.S. saw significant percentages of Roaming Mantis attacks, attributed to large mobile device user bases and strategic locations facilitating malware spread.

### Hijacking Your Way In
The malware operates by downloading a malicious app onto the victim’s device, then altering DNS server settings to redirect traffic to attacker-controlled servers.

### The Trojan Horse Within
This redirection facilitates further malware installation on the victim’s device, such as keyloggers and spyware, to steal sensitive information.

### Hook, Line, and Sinker: How Roaming Mantis Reels in Victims with Phishing Emails

**Behind the Bait:** Attackers craft phishing emails mimicking legitimate sources, embedding links to fake login pages designed to deceive victims into submitting their credentials.

**Click, Click, Infected:** Unsuspecting victims are directed to these counterfeit pages, where entering login information leads to data compromise.

**Hooked and Hacked:** The harvested credentials enable attackers to access and exploit personal and financial information from the victims' accounts.

### How Roaming Mantis Allows Attackers to Take Over Your Device

**Uninvited Guest:** Roaming Mantis gains remote access through DNS hijacking, establishing a covert connection between the victim’s device and the attacker’s server.

**Seizing Control:** With remote access, attackers can commandeer devices, stealing information, installing malware, or launching further attacks, exploiting the infected device as a pivot for broader cyber assaults.

### Eliminating Roaming Mantis: How to Banish the Mobile Malware Menace

#### Fortify Your Defenses

- **Antivirus Software**: Regular scans with reputable antivirus can detect and remove malware threats.
- **Layered Security**: Employ a combination of antivirus, secure DNS services, and VPNs to enhance protection.
- **Secure DNS Services**: Services like DNSFilter can block malicious DNS requests, thwarting DNS hijacking attempts.
- **VPN Use**: Encrypting internet traffic with a VPN protects against data interception.
- **Regular Updates**: Keeping devices and apps updated closes security loopholes.

#### Malware Meltdown: Steps to Recover

- **Disconnect**: Immediately disconnect infected devices from all networks.
- **Remove Malicious Apps**: Use device settings or antivirus software to uninstall unauthorized applications.
- **Change Credentials**: Reset all passwords and login information potentially compromised by the malware.

### DNSFilter: Your Secret Weapon Against Roaming Mantis Malware on Mobile Devices

DNSFilter emerges as a pivotal defense against Roaming Mantis by obstructing access to malicious domains and IP addresses utilized by the malware for communication. Its capabilities extend beyond simple domain blocking:

- **Threat Intelligence Feeds**: Incorporates up-to-date intelligence to identify and block malicious entities.
- **DNS-Based Blocking**: Prevents access to harmful domains at the DNS query level, offering a proactive security layer.
- **Machine Learning AI**: Employs advanced algorithms to detect and mitigate emerging threats, adapting to new malware tactics.

Leveraging DNSFilter, alongside other security measures, fortifies defenses against Roaming Mantis and evolving cyber threats.
